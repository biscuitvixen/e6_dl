# Sandy's e621 Pool Downloader
This is a little python package that I pretty much made for myself, since
I couldn't find any other script that would do this exactly how I wanted!

This downloads pools (specifically designed for comics) from e621.net.  
It will create a folder for each pool, named:  
**`{Pool Name} by {Artist Name}`**  

Inside each folder, it will download each image/gif/video in the pool, named:  
**`{Page Number}.{ext}`** (according to the order in the pool).  

Finally, it will create an **internet shortcut file (`.url`)** that will open the pool in your default browser.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install pipx**
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then install pipx for isolated package management:

```

*Note: You'll need to restart your terminal after running `pipx ensurepath`.*

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install the CLI Tool**
Install the package globally with isolated dependencies:

```bash
pipx install .
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Installation**
After installation, you should be able to run:

```bash
e6 --help
```

If you see the help message, you're good to go! The `e6` command is now available globally.

## Usage
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Download a single pool**
Run:
```bash
e6 123456
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Download multiple pools**

```bash
e6 123456 987654 ...
```
You can specify multiple pools to download at once.

This will:
- Check all pools in your database for new posts
